Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Good day Professor.

In the index file of my project it simply just introduces the reader and directs them to the other pages.

In the about.html file, the page contains general information about me along with an image.

In the athletics.html page, it gives the reader a general view about my athletic life and also directs the reader to go the another page that contains my stats of the season.

In the soccerathletic.html page, that page just contains my stats for the last season.

All pages have a navigation bar at the top that takes you to any of the main pages(Home, About me and Athletics).

I also employed the use of scss in my project.
