 <p> My athletic career began my sophomore year of High School. My first sport
   was soccer which was and is primary sport and then I played tennis in the spring.</p>

    SOCCER STATS
   </button>
   <ul class  = "h3box" >
   <ul > -> I have been playing soccer since I was a kid mostly just for fun.</ul>
   <ul > -> I started playing soccer in the USA my tenth grade year in high school and have only played two seasons since then.</ul>
   <ul> -> My primary position on the team is Goalkeeper:
       <ol> **My dream had always been to play as a goalkeeper. It mainly started because I was practically the talleast athletically
         skilled person in my class and no one else was willing to play. Soon I began to develop and it kinda stuck to me.</ol>
       <ol> **The only difference with playing High school in Nigeria and the USA is the level of skill and development. Here, its more
         technical and organised. At first playing was a challenge because it was new envoronment and I had  to chage my mindset about the game as a whole.</ol></ul></ul>

   <h2 class = "h2e"> My Development over the years:</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>I sarted playing junior varsity with pretty much zero experience. Soon, I was bumoed the varsity for the beginning
         of my first season. I barely played games but it helped me learn too.</li>
       <li> Soon, I joined a community club and we wnet and won the competition giving me my first trophy and medal</li>
       <li> I continued with their futsal team winning the County's futsal competition my first time playing barely missing out on the best goalkeeper award</li>
       <li> A couple months later I joined an upcoming academy that allowed me to develop some core values as a goalkeeper</li>
       <li> In the summer of the same year, I trained with the DC United Academy's Goalkeeper Coach</li>
       <li> My learning there over a couple weeks helped me gain a first team starter position</li>
       <li> I have since trained with different Academy players and even tried out for the DC United Academy</li></ul>
