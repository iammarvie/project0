    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p> My name is Mordecai Ethapemi. I am a senior at parkdale high school in Maryland. I am 16 years old with an affinity for computers and also sports.</p>
    <h3> Where I am from:</h3>
    <p> I currently live in Maryland but I am originally from Nigeria.</p>
    <h3> What I am and what I do: </h3>
    <p> I am an high school student-athlete. My primary studies are based upon science and technology and I plan to further that in college.
      At first, My dream was to become an engineer. This dream led me to begin my involvements in various sciences.
      Although it is not my focus anymore, I still try to learn as much as i can about chemical, mechanical and geographical sciences.
      Now, I have an interest in programming. I see it as the base for the next world we will be in and won't it be great to be at the forefornt of such developments.
      My dream as a programmer; although broad, is to further my development in software development and soon begin to develop applications and software
      and also Artificial Intelligence.</p>
    <p> I am a student-athlete. Right now, I play soccer which is my main sport and also tennis.
      Over the years, I have been involved in multiple sports including volleyball, ping-pong(Table-tennis), track and hand-ball.
      Most of my athletic activities were done back in Nigeria but that love for sports has still kept me participating till today. I hope to further my participation
      into college and maybe become professional.
